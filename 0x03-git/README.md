# The Unix manual pages (RTFM)
RTFM in Linux means Read The F** Manual. Before using any command in the shell, make sure that you have read the manual and understand how it works. This includes even the git commands.

Unix-like operating systems – including Linux, BSD, and OSX – have command-line help files called `man pages` (manual pages). The usual way to access to `man` pages is via the `man` command.

You may be told to RTFM which means Read the F*** Manual. That’s what this page is about.

First, we need to know how manual pages are displayed on your screen.
